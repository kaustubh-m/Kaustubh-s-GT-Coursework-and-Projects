Section B

1. My implementation of random forests gave an accuracy of 78.63 % (against Weka’s 88%). Possible reasons include Weka’s 10-fold cross validation, differences in forest size (I used n=10 based on performance and accuracy trade-off), number of attributes chosen for splitting, etc.

2. I used the SMO (Sequential Minimal Optimization) to train a Support Vector classifier, which yielded an accuracy of 78.6%. The chief advantage: much lower training time – one third that of Random Forests. An SVD uses only Support Vectors to define the separating hyperplane – it does not use all the data points. This makes the SVD quicker to train, and gives decent accuracy. I transformed the output (Classification) from numeric to Nominal before passing it to the SVD. Also used 10-fold cross validation.
