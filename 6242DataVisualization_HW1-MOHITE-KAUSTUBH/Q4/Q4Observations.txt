c) i) 1) key collision (fingerprint) is better because: it leads to fewer clusters - 68 vs. 174, it performs much faster, and it produces clusters that are named with the common text (e.g. 'DINNER'), rather than the specific text of one particular instance (as done by KNN - e.g. 15th ANNUAL DINNER)
      2) key collision (fingerprint) and (ngram fingerprint) produced similar numbers of clusters, however, ngram fingerprints ignored punctuation, whitespace and contraol characters, whereas fingerprint included them in the clustering.

c) iii) Nominal data: 'location'; Ordinal data: 'date'

c) v) Splitting a column into multiple columns based on a specified splitting character. I split the column 'Notes' into multiple notes based on ';'. This can allow us to analyse each note as a separate piece of text, and is potentially useful in text mining.
